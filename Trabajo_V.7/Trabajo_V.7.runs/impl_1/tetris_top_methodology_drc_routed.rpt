TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_100MHz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_100MHz_IBUF_inst/O, u_clk_wiz/clk_in1, vga_inst/clk_100MHz
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell board_inst/cnt_game[31]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) vga_inst/h_count_reg[5]/CLR, vga_inst/h_count_reg[6]/CLR,
vga_inst/h_count_reg[7]/CLR, vga_inst/h_count_reg[8]/CLR,
vga_inst/h_count_reg[9]/CLR, vga_inst/v_count_reg[0]/CLR,
vga_inst/v_count_reg[1]/CLR, vga_inst/v_count_reg[2]/CLR,
vga_inst/v_count_reg[3]/CLR, vga_inst/v_count_reg[4]/CLR,
vga_inst/v_count_reg[5]/CLR, vga_inst/v_count_reg[6]/CLR,
vga_inst/v_count_reg[7]/CLR, vga_inst/v_count_reg[8]/CLR,
vga_inst/v_count_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 411 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
